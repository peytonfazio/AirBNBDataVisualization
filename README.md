# AirBNBDataVisualization

This is a data visualization made for the business track of the ["Kent Hack Enough" 2025 Hackathon](https://khe.io/). It takes in data from the [Airbnb Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata/data) and provides analytics to help users understand the data better.

## Usage

Use the New York state heatmap to find the density of Airbnb rentals in each county. Select a different color palette if the default red-green heatmap is not preferable (this feature was included for the sake of color blind users).

Select a county to view additional information.

The parallel coordinates plot provides insights into clusters of data. Each distinct cluster is colored differently. Each thread in the plot represents a different point of data. 

Select two axes of data to view a linear regression chart and associated coefficient of regression.
